                                wanted the perfect outdoor screen to watch movies next to a
                                bonfire and under the stars with friends at his Woods Pond home.

                                and get more in tune with building again, being outside. This
                                idea just kind of laid into that at the right time. I love what

                                the eye with that setup and that's when I started to think,
                                'Well, maybe I can design an outdoor projector stand that would
                                hold all of these components and make it act almost like an
                                entertainment system that's inside your house where you have to
                                never remove everything, it stays plugged in, and when you're
                                ready to watch movies, you just carry this projector stand out
                                with all of the equipment to get it set up in front of the movie

                                150-inch diagonal screens. Once the frames are set up outdoors,
                                they're built to stay out year-round but remain moveable around
                                the yard. Screens hang on a grommet system and take less than
                                two minutes to attach, Morton said.
