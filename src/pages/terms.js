                                    other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by
                                    final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal

                                    administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a
                                    similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a
                                    location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's
                                    award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in
                                    any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or

                                    attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes

                                    a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that
                                    the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                                    enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including

                                    shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration
                                    provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and
