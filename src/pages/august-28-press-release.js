                                <strong>BRIDGTON, MAINE – August 28, 2022 – The Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company, </strong>a premier provider of complete outdoor movie theater solutions for homeowners, today announced a significant product enhancement to the Timberline Series Movable Screen Frame. The reinforced screen frame system has added base support to help with stability when moving to different locations on your property, making it the strongest movable screen frame system available.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            The movable screen frame has new front bottom 45-degree angle side supports, making the frame solid and sturdy. With the Timberline Movable Screen Frame System, there's no need to break it down and place it back into storage until the next time you use it. Once the frame system is set up on your property, it is designed to remain fully assembled outdoors, allowing for a fast setup so you can start watching your favorite entertainment like you would inside your home.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            "The new Timberline Movable Screen Frame makes it easier to move to different locations on your property without putting stress on the frame joints with the added base frame supports and timber-frame hardware," said Todd Morton, owner of the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company. "Adding new base supports to the frame system also allows you to transport the fully assembled screen to your next big outdoor event, such as a family reunion or wedding reception. Get a couple of people, load it onto a flatbed trailer, and take it anywhere.”
