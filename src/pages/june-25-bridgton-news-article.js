                                Todd Morton, the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company owner, was interviewed at his home in Bridgton, Maine, on June 20, 2020.

                                Todd Morton has had a diverse working career. He has done construction, finish carpentry and built a couple of log homes. And he worked 25 years as an Internet marketer and website designer. Now he hopes to add the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company to his professional accomplishments.                            </p>

                                “I want to create an outdoor experience that the entire family will enjoy,” he said.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-xl text-base press-text font-normal pb-5">
                                Todd has always had a great appreciation for the outdoors and grew up in northern Vermont. His true passions have always been working outdoors and nature. For years, Todd thought about putting up a backyard movie screen for years and started testing various outdoor set ups that turned out to be flimsy or too cumbersome to setup and watch.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-xl text-base press-text font-normal pb-5">
                                During the winter, Todd continued researching outdoor cinema setups but found most failed to hold up due to uneven ground conditions and wind. “I brainstormed for months how I could set up a sturdy, rugged stationary movie screen frame, that I wouldn’t have to inflate or deflate at the end of the movie and make it look aesthetically clean on my property,” he said.
                            </p>

                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-xl text-base press-text font-normal pb-5">
                                Todd built a pressure-treated movie screen frame, which can easily be moved by two people. All hardware used on the outdoor wooden frame is weather-resistant galvanized and stainless steel. “This frame is built to last,” he said. The cinematic polyester screens come in three sizes – 96”, 120” and 150” and attach to the frame with grommet holes and stainless steel hooks. To put the screen on the frame takes less time than it does to pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, Todd said.

                                “You can set up the wireless outdoor cinema anywhere on your property. After watching my first movie outside, I knew other homeowners would love this experience. Being outside in the fresh air seeing the galaxy of stars and moon is incredible, nothing beats the experience,” he said. I envision people watching movies outside with family and friends, having Halloween parties in October, watching the Super Bowl, all you need to stay warm in the cooler months is a good old fashion campfire or a propane heat lamp. And with social distancing, you can spread out lawn chairs and still safely watch a movie, sporting event, play video games together with friends.”

                                The HD Wi-Fi projector (which is positioned six to seven feet away from the screen) sets on either a projector stand or a custom-build cedar projector stand with shelves. The off-grid battery station powers the outdoor cinema where there’s no need to run any extension cords out to the electronic components. And the off-grid battery comes with a built-in flashlight to help with finding your way back inside.
