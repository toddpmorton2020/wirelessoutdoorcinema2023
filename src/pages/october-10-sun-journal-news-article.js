                                <strong>October 10, 2021 — BRIDGTON — </strong>Todd Morton
                                wanted the perfect outdoor movie theater setup to watch movies next to a
                                bonfire under the stars and moon with friends and family at his Woods Pond home.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                                Inflatable air screen offerings took 30 minutes to blow up with an air compressor and they didn't blend in with his wooded backyard. Telescoping tripods screen frame systems only work on perfectly flat ground and weren't rugged enough.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                                He hit his wood shop and built a business.

                                The Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company launched in the spring of
                                2020 after a year of experimenting with the right setup.

                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            For 20 years, Morton, 49, worked in the high-technology field as an internet marketer selling consumer products online for companies such as Lycos (the internet search company) and Dragon Naturally Speaking Software (a division owned by Microsoft).

                                After a large corporate layoff four years ago, "I took a break," he
                                said. "I knew I wanted to do something different in my career,
                                and get back to my passion of wood working and being outside. This
                                idea just kind of laid into that at the right time. I love what
                                I do. I'm growing it."
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            Step one was deciding on screen frame systems on the market that didn't fit his movie-viewing vision.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            "I know from experience, getting anything inflatable has the potential of getting tears or leaks and knew the air screen cinemas on the market were not going to make the cut," Morton said.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            Step two was deciding on projector stands on the market, which didn't fit that vision either.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            "The telescopic tripod projector shelf stands on the market can only hold a projector and none of the other cinema electronics," he said.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            Like a DVD player, laptop, receiver, tuner, battery station, or bluetooth speakers.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            "After I built my first wooden screen frame system, the next challenge was setting up the cinema electronics and organizing them, as no outdoor projector stands are available on the market." Morton said. "I would stack milk crates on top of each other and use 5-gallon buckets to place my cinema electronics on, which didn't look aesthetically pleasing to the eye. That's when I decided to design a portable, lightweight projector stand built out of pinewood to neatly organize all of the cinema equipment - similar to an entertainment center. At the end of the night, when the movie is over, all you have to do is bring the projector stand inside, and nothing has to be unplugged or boxed up so it's ready to use for your next outdoor movie night."
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            He sells 12-foot wide screen frame systems to fit 150-inch diagonal screens. Once the screen frames are set up outdoors, they're built to stay out year-round but remain moveable around the yard. Screen options include manual pull-down projector screens and cinematic grommet hole screens, which take less than two minutes to attach, Morton said.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            Screen Frame Systems are built out of 4" x 4" pressure-treated lumber and projector stands are built out of a lightweight pinewood in his wood shop and take two to three days. Sales so far have been within Maine, but he can travel all over New England to deliver and set up for customers.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            Packages, including screen frame systems, screens, cinema equipment, and custom projector stand, start at $2,899.

                            His favorite two movies to watch under the stars are "Lost Boys," "which brings me back to being a teenager hanging out with friends and family watching Halloween movies," and "Tombstone," "which reminds me of watching Western movies with my dad."
