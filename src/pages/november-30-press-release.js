                                <strong>BRIDGTON, MAINE – November 30, 2023 – The Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company, </strong>a premier provider of complete outdoor movie theater solutions for homeowners, today announced the availability of the new Timberline Free-Standing Screen Frame. The new screen frame is designed for homeowners who can’t dig into the ground due to ledge stone or if they have uneven ground.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            The Timberline Free-Standing Screen Frame was developed from the demand of homeowners who couldn’t use the Wireless Outdoor Cinema’s Movable or Cemented Screen Frames due to being unable to dig into the ground and having uneven backyards. The new frame is supported by the base boxes, which have 4” x 4” pressure-treated inside supports that keep the frame upright and solid.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            "After going to several customers' homes to evaluate an outdoor movie theater setup and being unable to come up with a theater solution due to their uneven backyards that had ledge stone, I came up with an idea of designing a new screen frame that solved this challenge," said Todd Morton, owner of the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company.”
