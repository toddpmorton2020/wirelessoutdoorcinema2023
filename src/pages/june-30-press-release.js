                                <strong>BRIDGTON, MAINE – June 30, 2022 – The Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company </strong>today announced the unveiling of the new Timberline Outdoor Projector Stand that solves the challenge of organizing your cinema equipment and getting your projector to cast movies at the proper height onto the projector screen from a series of calculations.
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            Currently, no outdoor projector stands are available online because manufacturers know that every homeowner with a backyard has a different landscape and movie screen setup, and one size only does not meet everyone's requirements.                            
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            The custom outdoor projector stand allows you to organize and store your cinema equipment like your home's entertainment center, where you never need to break down the equipment after use. Handcrafted and built from solid pinewood, the projector stand is sturdy, lightweight and easy to carry.                            
                            </p>
                            <p className="max-w-full mb-0 sm:text-lg text-base font-normal pb-5">
                            "When I searched the internet last year to find a projector stand to go with my wireless outdoor movie theaters, there were no options other than the telescopic tripod projector shelf stands, which can not hold or organize all of the necessary cinema equipment," said Todd Morton, founder of the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company. "After a year of designing, building, and testing various outdoor projector stands in my woodshop, I came up with a design that organizes the cinema equipment and a formula that calculates the proper height that the projector needs to be at to cast movies perfectly onto the projector screen."                            </p>
