                                <strong>BRIDGTON, MAINE – March 11, 2024 – The Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company, </strong>a premier provider of complete outdoor movie theater solutions for homeowners, today announced the release of the only professional DIY Guide available on how to build an outdoor movie theater for homeowners nationwide. The detailed DIY Guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to easily build, assemble, and install a professional outdoor home movie theater, with a detailed .pdf manual and access to how-to videos.

                            The DIY Guide covers all four flagship products the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company offers customers throughout New England. It includes three different 12' wide by 10' high wooden screen frame systems designed for every type of property landscape, and a one-of-kind custom wooden projector stand built off the calculations of your property's landscape and screen frame system.

                            "I developed the professional DIY Guide to help homeowners solve the challenge of setting up a sustainable backyard movie theater that doesn't need to be broken down and stored away after use," said Todd Morton, owner of the Wireless Outdoor Cinema Company. "There are a lot of DIY Guides available online, and the majority are incomplete, provide novice advice, and use China-made screen frame systems that need to be broken down after use and stored away. My outdoor movie theaters are designed to be an extension of your living room, where the wooden screen frame system stays up on your property year-round, allowing for a fast and easy setup every time you want to enjoy a movie outside.”
